# Jake's Portfolio

# The What
Files for my new portfolio website. Made with HTML and CSS.

# The Why
I need to practice my skills in building beautiful websites, while also building somewhere to showcase them. Kill two birds with one stone!

# The When
This will be an ongoing process, as each new skill I learn will allow me to add more to the site. Currently, I would love to add

* A parallax scrolling effect
* A header that tranistions from a clear background to a solid one
* Links and Icons to change color on hover
* Better responsivness
